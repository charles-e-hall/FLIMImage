# FLIMImage
MATLAB-based software for the acquisition and analysis of 2-photon Fluorescence Lifetime Images
Developed by Ryohei Yasuda

Version Information:
This version of FLIM Image is distributed as a unix patch file for ScanImage 3.8.1, which can be downloaded from Vidrio Technologies.  Once the patch is applied, you will need to update the MATLAB path.  Then the next time that you launch ScanImage, you should see numerous additional windows that allow for FLIM imaging.
